# lua-resty-aws


## Overview

AWS SDK for OpenResty. The SDK is generated from the [original AWS JavaScript
repository details](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/tree/master/apis).

[The documentation](https://kong.github.io/lua-resty-aws/topics/README.md.html)
will mostly cover the specifics for this library, the actual
[services invoked are documented by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/).

For a quick start on how to use this library checkout
[the examples of the AWS class](https://kong.github.io/lua-resty-aws/classes/AWS.html).

---

## Status

This library is under early development. Not everything has been implemented,
and testing is hard since it requires access to AWS resources and not just
regular CI.

---

## Installation

Installation is easiest using LuaRocks:

    luarocks install lua-resty-aws

To install from the git repo:

    git clone https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-aws.git
    cd lua-resty-aws
    make install

---

## Development

To update the SDK version being used edit the version tag in [`update_api_files.sh`](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-aws/blob/main/update_api_files.sh)
and then run:

    make dev

Make sure to run `make dev` to pull in the generated files. Documentation can be
generated using [ldoc](https://github.com/lunarmodules/LDoc) by running:

    make docs

---

## Testing

Tests are executed using Busted and LuaCheck:

    busted
    luacheck .

or run

    make test

---

## To do

- Implement the request/response objects (more AWS like, currently Lua modules)
- Implement additional signatures (only V4 currently)
- Implement retries from the global config
- Additional tests for other services
